text {* Arithmetic expressions (@{text exp}) consist of variables, constants, and
arithmetic operations. Boolean expressions (@{text bexp}) consist of comparisons
between arithmetic expressions.  Commands (@{text cmd}) include the empty command,
variable assignments, memory reads, writes, allocations and deallocations,
sequential and parallel composition, conditionals, while loops, local variable
declarations, resource declarations and conditional critical regions (CCRs).
